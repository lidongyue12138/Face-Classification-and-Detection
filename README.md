# Project 1: Face Classification and Detection

### TO DO

1. Face Classification
   - Data Processing
     - Generate positive samples: by the annotation of the dataset
     - Generate negative samples: by resizing or by sliding windows
     - Extract HOG features
     - Generate training set and testing set
   - Model Building
     - Logistic Model
       - SGD
       - Langevin dynamics
     - Fisher Model
     - SVM Model
     - CNN Model
   - Visualization
     - Visualize bounding boxes of positive and negative samples on images. 
     - Visualize the extracted HOG features 
     - Visualize face detection results and feature distribution
